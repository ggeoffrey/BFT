So let's talk the fairy way!  
Made with the almighty [Clojure](http://clojure.org/), the red pill that takes you down the rabbit hole.  


###  Abtract

A Clojure library designed to translate boolean functions back and forth different normal forms.

At the moment, can transform:
- From truth table
  - to CNF
  - to BNF

## Usage

This is a work in progress, comming soon ;)

#### Why Clojure? 

Because it's a functionnal, [homoiconic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homoiconicity) programmable programming language. Allowing a program to create programs, and a function to create and manipulate functions' code. As we are transforming boolean functions, is there a better suited language than a Lisp? Are you able to write, parse, and manipulate the AST at runtime with a classic imperative language? Think about it.
